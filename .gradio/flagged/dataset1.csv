1. INTRODUCTION 
 
The Functional Requirements Specifications (FRS) report provides the detailed description 
of the functionalities required for the first version of the CCTNS. The key guiding principle 
behind the functional design of CCTNS V1.0 is to focus on the critical functionality that 
provides value to the police personnel at the cutting edge which in turn can improve the 
outcomes in the areas of “Investigation of Crime” and “Detection of Criminals”. 
 
2. FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW 
 
CCTNS V1.0 functionality is designed to focus on delivering value to IOs, records room 
staff and citizens within the broad crime investigation area. Based on the guiding principles 
stated above, nine different function blocks have been identified and the detailed 
functionality of each block was determined.

3. DESCRIPTION OF THE MODULES AND FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS 
 
The functionality of the CCTNS application is focused on providing value to the police 
personnel, especially the officers operating at the cutting edge and easing the day to day 
operations of the police function.  
 
Registration 
Citizens can register their complaints with police and then based on the evidence, facts and 
following investigation, police shall take the complaint forward. The Registration module 
acts as an interface between the police and citizens and it eases the approach, interaction and 
information exchange between police and complainants. 
 
Investigation 
After a complaint is initiated, police initiates the investigation process. The Investigation 
module of the CCTNS facilitates the investigation process and introduces operational 
efficiencies by automating most of the tasks that take place after initial entries are made 
during Registration. 
 
Prosecution 
Interfacing with the courts during the prosecution of cases is an integral part of the 
responsibilities of police personnel. A designated constable from each police station 
constantly interfaces with the courts. The Prosecution module of the CCTNS aids this 
interfacing by providing a platform to record entries of the court interactions. 
 
Search 
The Search module of the CCTNS gives police personnel the ability to execute a basic or 
advanced search on cases. Using the search functionality, police personnel can search for a 
particular person, type of crime, modus operandi, property etc. It also gives the user the 
ability to customize the results view by criminal/accused or by cases. It makes reporting easy 
for police by enabling them to execute different types of queries such as monthly reporting, 
RTI related etc.

Citizen Interface 
The Citizen Interface module of the CCTNS acts as a conduit for the information exchange 
between citizens and police units/personnel. Citizens can use it as a tool to get information 
or acknowledgements from police. The police in turn can use it to respond to citizens with 
very little turnaround time. It improves overall productivity by helping citizens and police to 
cut short the drudgery of large amounts of paperwork. 
 
Navigation 
The Navigation module of the CCTNS provides role based landing pages which help in 
navigating through the CCTNS application. It shows information such as cases assigned, 
alerts, pending tasks etc hence helping police personnel to plan better and execute with 
greater efficiency. 
 
Application Configuration 
The Configuration module of the CCTNS helps keep the application configured according 
to the states’ requirements in addition to keeping data elements/rules up to date. With a 
proper configuration, information such as act and sections, state specific data, castes, tribes, 
property information etc. can be created updated and deleted. 
 
The functional requirements for each of the modules are provided as A1 to A7 in separate 
enclosures.

4. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS 
 
The non-functional requirements specify the qualitative attributes such as user-friendliness 
and performance of the system that are critical for the increased user-acceptance of the 
application. 
 
Help Module 
1.  
The solution should provide detailed context-sensitive help material for all the 
possible actions and scenarios on all user interfaces in the application. 
2.  
The help should be accessible to the users both in the offline and online mode 
 
Support Module 
1.  
The solution should provide an interface for the user to log any defects or 
enhancement requests on the application and track thereafter. 
2.  
The solution should send alerts (e.g., email, SMS) to the user if the user chooses 
to whenever any action has been taken on the alert 
3.  
The solution should enable the user to track the submitted defect or 
enhancement request. 
4.  
The solution should enable the help-desk user to view the reports on the 
submitted defects or enhancement requests category-wise, status-wise, and age-
wise. 
5.  
The support solution should be accessible to the users both from within the 
application and also outside the application through a browser interface. 
 
 Audit Module 
1.  
An audit trail is a record of actions taken by either the user or the system 
triggers. This includes actions taken by users or Administrators, or actions 
initiated automatically by the system as a result of system parameters. The 
System must keep an unalterable audit trail capable of automatically capturing 
and storing information about: 
• All the actions (create/read/update/delete) that are taken upon the critical 
entities (case, suspect, property,…) in the system 
• The user initiating and or carrying out the action; 
• The date and time of the event. 
E-Governance Mission Mode Project: Crime & Criminals Tracking Network and Systems 
Ministry of Home Affairs                               Draft Core Scope Document                                 Page 7 of 19 
• Administrative parameters 
The word “unalterable” is to mean that the audit trail data cannot be modified 
in any way or deleted by any user; it may be subject to re-department and 
copying to removable media if required, so long as its contents remain 
unchanged. 
2.  
Once the audit trail functionality has been activated, the System must track 
events without manual intervention, and store in the audit trail information 
about them. 
3.  
The System must maintain the audit trail for as long as required, which will be at 
least for the life of the case to which it refers. 
4.  
The System must ensure that audit trail data is available for inspection on 
request, so that a specific event can be identified and all related data made 
accessible, and that this can be achieved by authorised external personnel who 
have little or no familiarity with the system. 
5.  
The System must be able to export audit trails for specified cases (without 
affecting the audit trail stored by the System). This functionality can be used by 
external auditors who wish to examine or analyse system activity. 
6.  
The System must be able to capture and store violations (i.e. A user’s attempts 
to access a case to which he is denied access), and (where violations can validly 
be attempted) attempted violations, of access control mechanisms. 
7.  
The System must at a minimum be able to provide reports for actions on cases 
organised: 
• By case; 
• By user; 
• In chronological sequence. 
8.  
The System should be able to provide reports for actions on cases organised by 
workstation and (where technically appropriate) by network address. 
 
The requirements specify the requirements to control the user access to correspondences, 
files, and records and various functionalities provided within the system.  
Access Module 
1.  
The System must allow the user to limit access to cases to specified users or 
user groups. 
2.  
The system should provide for role-based control for the functionality within 
E-Governance Mission Mode Project: Crime & Criminals Tracking Network and Systems 
Ministry of Home Affairs                               Draft Core Scope Document                                 Page 8 of 19 
the system. 
3.  
The System must allow a user to be a member of more than one group. 
4.  
The System must allow only admin-users to set up user profiles and allocate 
users to groups. 
5.  
The System should allow a user to stipulate which other users or groups can 
access cases.  
6.  
The System must allow changes to security attributes for groups or users (such 
as access rights, security level, privileges, password allocation and management) 
to be made only by super-user. 
7.  
If a user requests access to, or searches for, a case which he does not have the 
right to access, the System must provide one of the following responses 
(selectable at configuration time): 
• display title and metadata; 
• display the existence of a case but not its title or other metadata; 
• do not display any case information or indicate its existence in any way. 
These options are presented in order of increasing security.  Note that the 
requirement in the third option (i.e. the most stringent) implies that the System 
must not include such cases in any count of search results; this level of security 
is normally appropriate for cases dealing with matters such as national security. 
8.  
If a user performs a quick or advanced search, the System must never include in 
the search result list any record which the user does not have the right to access.
9.  
If the System allows users to make unauthorised attempts to access cases, it 
must log these in the audit trail.  
10.  
Any access to cases, and all other activities involving the cases and related 
documents or data should also need to be stored in the audit trail to ensure legal 
admissibility and to assist in data recovery. 
 
Ease of Use 
1. 
All error messages produced by the System must be meaningful, so that they can be 
appropriately acted upon by the users who are likely to see them. Ideally, each error 
message will be accompanied by explanatory text and an indication of the action(s) 
which the user can take in response to the error. 
2. 
The System must employ a single set of user interface rules, or a small number of 
sets to provide a familiar and common look and feel for the application.  
E-Governance Mission Mode Project: Crime & Criminals Tracking Network and Systems 
Ministry of Home Affairs                               Draft Core Scope Document                                 Page 9 of 19 
3. 
The System must be able to display several entities (cases, suspects) simultaneously. 
4. 
The interfaces must be made customizable or user-configurable to the extent 
possible. (e.g., the displayed columns in the table, move, resize, modify the 
appearance). Such configurations must be saved in the user profile. 
5. 
The System user interface must be suitable for users with special needs; that is, 
compatible with specialist software that may be used and with appropriate interface 
guidelines 
6. 
The System must provide End User and Administrator functions which are easy to 
use and intuitive throughout. 
7. 
The System must allow persistent defaults for data entry where desirable.  These 
defaults should include: 
• user-definable values; 
• values same as previous item; 
• values derived from context, e.g. date, file reference, user identifier; 
8. 
Frequently-executed System transactions must be designed so that they can be 
completed with a small number of interactions (e.g. mouse clicks). 
9. 
Where the System employs a graphical user interface, it must allow users to 
customise it. Customisation should include, but need not be limited to the following 
changes: 
• menu contents; 
• layout of screens; 
• use of function keys; 
• on-screen colours, fonts and font sizes; 
 
Usability 
1.  
The user interfaces should be designed to make them user-intuitive. 
2.  
The user interfaces of the system should comply with Standard ISO 9241. 
3.  
ICT accessibility: ISO 9241-20 shall be the standard for guidance on ICT 
accessibility. Application user interfaces to meet its requirements and 
recommendations. Software accessibility ISO 9241-171 shall be the standard for 
guidance on software accessibility. User interfaces should meet its requirements 
and recommendations. Content accessibility WCAG 1.0 shall be the standard used 
for guidance on content accessibility. The application logo to be available on all 
pages as a link to the home page. 
E-Governance Mission Mode Project: Crime & Criminals Tracking Network and Systems 
Ministry of Home Affairs                               Draft Core Scope Document                                 Page 10 of 19 
4.  
Providing text equivalents for non-text media objects: All non-text media objects, 
such as graphical images or video, should be provided with alternative equivalent 
textual descriptions and/or with equivalent text-based functionality. 
5.  
Making navigation self-descriptive: Navigation should be designed to help users 
understand where they are, where they have been and where they can go next. 
General guidance on achieving self-descriptiveness is given in ISO 9241-110.  
6.  
Showing users where they are: Each presentation segment (page or window) 
should provide the user with a clear and sufficient indication of where he or she is 
in the navigation structure and of the current segment position with respect to the 
overall structure. 
7.  
Offering alternative access paths: Alternative access paths for navigating to a 
specific unit of content should be offered to support different navigation 
strategies.  
8.  
Minimizing navigation effort: The number of navigation steps needed to reach a 
certain piece of content should be minimized as long as different mental models, 
navigation strategies and tasks of the user are taken into account.  
9.  
Splash screens should be avoided unless they provide useful content or feedback 
about the application state to the user. If a splash screen is used, a navigation 
option to skip it should be offered. 
10.  
Avoiding opening unnecessary windows: Additional windows such as new browser 
windows or pop-up windows should only be opened if this supports the user’s 
task. Opening new windows can distract, confuse or impede users for a variety of 
reasons. They can superimpose the primary window, hiding relevant information. 
They could make it cognitively more difficult to understand the navigation 
structure with negative effects on both usability and accessibility. They also require 
additional user actions for closing unwanted windows. 
11.  
Vertical scrolling should be minimized. This may be done by placing important 
information at the top and providing links to information that is further down the 
page. Horizontal scrolling should be avoided wherever possible. 
12.  
Designing for input device independence: User interfaces should be designed to 
allow activation of controls by a variety of input devices. The ability to choose 
between different input devices for activating controls such as links, fields and 
buttons is important both for users who prefer a certain input mode, mobile users 
and users with disabilities. In general, device independence can be achieved if the 
functionality is operable via a keyboard. 
13.  
Making user interfaces robust: User interfaces should be designed to be as robust 
as possible in the face of changing technology. This encompasses being able to 
present content containing newer technologies by older user agents as well as 
E-Governance Mission Mode Project: Crime & Criminals Tracking Network and Systems 
Ministry of Home Affairs                               Draft Core Scope Document                                 Page 11 of 19 
designing content to be usable with future technologies. 
14.  
Acceptable opening / download times: Application pages should be designed and 
implemented so that there are acceptable opening times and download times for 
the expected range of technical contexts of use (e.g. bandwidth between the 
application and the user). This is particularly important for frequently accessed 
pages or pages that are important for user navigation and exploration, such as the 
home page. 
15.  
Minimizing user errors:  Potential user errors as well as the effort needed to 
recover from errors should be minimized.  
16.  
Providing clear error messages: The content of error messages shown on the pages 
or special error pages should clearly state the reason why the error occurred and, if 
possible, actions the user can take to resolve the error. Users expect error messages 
to be in the same language as the user interface. 
17.  
Using appropriate formats, units of measurement or currency:  When designing 
user interfaces for use by diverse groups, input and output of information 
elements such as currency, units of measurement, temperatures, date and time, 
phone numbers, address or postal codes should be designed so that they are 
usable. 
18.  
Making text resizable by the user: Text should be able to be resized by the user, 
using functions provided by the user agent or other appropriate means i.e. see ISO 
9241-171.  
19.  
Text quality: The quality of textual content with respect to spelling and grammar 
should be sufficient so as not to impede readability. 
20.  
Writing style: The reading and understanding of the textual content on the screen 
should be supported by suitable means, including the use of short sentences, the 
division of the text into shorter chunks or the presentation of content items in the 
form of bullet points. 
21.  
Supporting text skimming: Fast skimming of text should be supported by the 
provision of clear links, bulleted lists, highlighted keywords, logical headings, and 
short phrases and sentences. 
22.  
Readability of text: Text presented on the pages should be readable taking into 
account the expected display characteristics and spatial arrangement. ISO 9241-303 
shall be consulted for screen text legibility requirements. 
23.  
Distinguishable within-page links: Within-page links should be clearly 
distinguishable from other links that lead to a different page. EX. Within-page 
links are shown with dashed rather than solid underlines 
24.  
Avoiding link overload:  Text pages containing large proportions of links should 
E-Governance Mission Mode Project: Crime & Criminals Tracking Network and Systems 
Ministry of Home Affairs                               Draft Core Scope Document                                 Page 12 of 19 
be formatted so that the presence of links does not impede the readability of the 
text.  
25.  
Using familiar terminology for navigation links: Navigation links — particularly 
links representing the main navigation structure — should be labelled with terms 
that are familiar to the user, based on his/her general knowledge, prior experience 
in the application domain or experience of using other systems. 
26.  
Using descriptive link labels: The target or purpose of a link should be directly 
indicated by its label, avoiding generic labels such as “go” or “click here” except 
where the purpose of the link is clear from its context on the page or the labels 
have commonly understood semantics in the particular application domain. Using 
appropriate terminology specific to the user’s tasks and information needs is 
important for making the content easy to understand. 
27.  
Marking links opening new windows: Links that open new browser windows or 
pop-up windows should be clearly marked. 
28.  
Distinguishing navigation links from controls: Navigation links should be clearly 
distinguishable from controls activating some action.  Typical action types in user 
interfaces 
include 
manipulating 
application 
data, 
performing 
searches, 
communication actions, such as opening a new e-mail window or starting a chat 
function, and Hpresentation-related actions, such as sorting a list of search results. 
29.  
Providing printable document versions: If a document is either too long, dispersed 
over several pages or in a specific layout that is not suitable for online reading, a 
printer-friendly version of the document should be provided that prints the 
content in a form acceptable to the user (e.g. in the expected layout, paper format, 
or orientation). 
30.  
Use of “white space”:  “White space” on a page i.e. space filled only with the 
background color should be used in such a way that it does not impair the visual 
skimming of the page. While white space is an important means of visually 
organizing the different content elements on a page, if the distance between the 
blocks of information displayed becomes too large, rapid skimming of the page 
can be impeded. 
31.  
Selecting appropriate page lengths The length of a page should be selected so as to 
support the primary purpose and use of the page. Short pages are generally more 
appropriate for homepages, navigation pages, or overview pages that need to be 
read quickly. Longer pages can be more appropriate when users want to read the 
content without interruptions or when the page needs to match a paper 
counterpart. 
32.  
Using colour: Colour should be used with care, taking into account human 
capabilities and restrictions in perceiving colour, and not as the only means of 
conveying information. Color should never be the only means of coding. Some 
users may have difficulties in perceiving certain colors or color combinations 
E-Governance Mission Mode Project: Crime & Criminals Tracking Network and Systems 
Ministry of Home Affairs                               Draft Core Scope Document                                 Page 13 of 19 
(color-blindness). 
33.  
Using frames with care: If frames are used, care should be taken to avoid possible 
problems, for example, those involving the use of the back button, bookmarking 
of pages, or scrolling of information. When frames are used, it is important to title 
each frame, and to describe its purpose and how frames relate to one another 
other. 
34.  
Providing alternatives to frame-based presentation: If frames are used, an 
alternative way of presenting relevant information without frames should be 
provided. Providing alternative text-only pages: When style sheets and/or frames 
are turned off it should be possible for the user to read and understand the page; 
alternatively, the user should be provided with an equivalent alternative text-only 
page. 
35.  
Consistent page layout: Pages should be designed using consistent layout schemes, 
supporting the user in finding similar information at the same position on different 
pages. Overall layout schemes apply to all pages and are preferable when all pages 
have a similar structure. Frequently, however, different pages have different 
purposes and types of content. In such cases, pages can usually be grouped in 
different categories, using one layout scheme for each category consistently. 
36.  
Placing title information consistently: Page titles should be placed in a consistent 
location on the different pages. 
37.  
Observing principles of human perception When designing application pages, the 
general principles of human perception should be taken into account. The 
International Standards mentioned below shall be consulted for guidance. Practical 
guidelines for presenting information to the user are to be found in ISO 9241-12. 
Guidance on selecting and using different forms of interaction techniques is to be 
found in ISO 9241-14 to ISO 9241-17. ISO 9241-14 gives guidance about menus, 
ISO 9241-15 about command dialogues, ISO 9241-16 about direct manipulation 
and ISO 9241-17 about forms. In addition, when designing multimedia 
information presentations, the design principles and recommendations described 
in ISO 14915-1 to ISO 14915-3 should be taken into account. Appropriate content 
presentation also plays a key role in accessibility.  
38.  
Linking back to the home page or landmark pages: Each page should contain a 
link leading to the home page of the application or to a landmark page that is easy 
to recognize for the user. 
39.  
Providing a site map: A separate navigation overview such as a site map should be 
provided for application showing the structure of the site in an overview form.  
40.  
Consistency between navigation components and content: If navigation 
components (or overviews) are shown in conjunction with associated content, 
consistency between the navigation component and the content shown should be 
maintained by indicating in the navigation  component (e.g. highlighting) the topic 
E-Governance Mission Mode Project: Crime & Criminals Tracking Network and Systems 
Ministry of Home Affairs                               Draft Core Scope Document                                 Page 14 of 19 
currently visible in the content area.  
41.  
Placing navigation components consistently: Navigation components should be 
placed consistently on the pages or in the framesets in the pages of the application.
42.  
Individualization and user adaptation : Adapting the content and the navigation of 
a user interface to individual users or user groups can be a useful mechanism for 
providing information that is of interest to the users and for making access to 
relevant information more efficient. User adaptation can also be important for 
making the user interface more accessible. Different approaches can be used for 
achieving these goals, like providing users with means for customizing the user 
interface to their personal needs i.e. individualization designing content and 
navigation differently for varying user groups or roles i.e. such as employees of 
different levels, citizens etc, monitoring the user’s behaviour and adapting to the 
user’s goals that are inferred from the behaviour observed, recommending 
information that is potentially more relevant or interesting to the specific user, 
based on the behaviour of all users or a user group. 
43.  
Taking account of the users’ tasks and information needs: When providing 
different access paths or navigation structures for different user groups, the tasks 
and information needs of these user groups should be taken into consideration. 
44.  
Making individualization and adaptation evident: It should be made evident to the 
user when individualization and/or adaptation are used.  
45.  
Making user profiles evident: If predefined user profiles or user-specified profiles 
are used for individualizing or adapting content, the profile currently used should 
be made evident. If profiles are used, it is important to provide users with 
information about this concept and its implications. 
46.  
Allowing users to see and change profiles: If user-specified profiles are used, users 
should be able to see, modify and delete that profile on demand.  
47.  
The user interfaces of the system should follow the guidelines specified under 
www.usability.gov 
 
 
System Availability 
1.  
The System must be available to users: 
• from <xx:00> to <xx:00>; 
• on <all weekdays/xxx days per year>. 
2.  
The planned downtime for the System must not exceed <xx> hours per <rolling 
three month period>.

The System is considered to be down if any user is unable to perform any normal 
System function and if this failure is attributed to any component of the System 
other than the workstation. 
3.  
Unplanned downtime for the System must not exceed <xx hours/minutes> per

4.  
The number of incidents of unplanned downtime for the System must not exceed 
<x> per <rolling three month period>. 
5.  
In the event of any software or hardware failure, it must be possible to restore the 
System (with inline synchronization) within no more than <xx> hours. 
 
 
Performance and Scalability 
1.  
The System must provide adequate response times for commonly performed 
functions under both standard and peak conditions 
2.  
The System must be able to perform a simple search within 5-8 seconds and a 
advanced search (multiple search criteria) within 10-15 seconds regardless of the 
storage capacity or number of cases in the system. In this context, performing a 
search means returning a result list.  It does not include retrieving the records 
themselves. 
3.  
The System must be able to retrieve and display within 5-8 seconds the case which 
has been accessed within the previous 2 months, regardless of storage capacity or 
number of cases in the system. This requirement is intended to allow for rapid 
retrieval of frequently-used cases, on the understanding that frequency of use is 
typically correlated with recent use.  
4.  
The System must be able to retrieve and display within 20 seconds the case which 
has not been accessed within the previous 2 months, regardless of storage capacity 
or number of cases in the system. This requirement is intended to allow for cases 
where cases used infrequently are stored on slower media than more active 
records. 
5.  
The System be scaleable and must not have any features which would preclude use 
in small or large police stations, with varying numbers of cases handled.

5. FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURE RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
The proposed functional architecture is modeled around centralized deployment to facilitate 
ease of maintenance and leverage advancement in open standards and web technologies. 
 
The 3 C’s (Core-Configuration-Customization) forms the guiding principle for the 
architecture. The functional architecture of the CCTNS solution is given in the figure below. 
The functional architecture is composed of 4 major components based on SOA principles. 
Each of the components contains multiple services as defined by Service Definition.  The 
core services, support layer and security and access control components can be deployed as 
standard components with necessary configuration changes. The customization layer can 
override and add to the core services based on the specific state requirements and can be 
plugged with the core services. 
 
CCTNS Functional Architecture Overview

The deployment of the application will be at state level and will be configured and 
customized as per the state specific extensions.  
 
The systems should be designed with the following broad guidelines: 
 
System Functionality 
1)
The system should support multilingual interface 
2) 
The system should be designed in manner that operational data is not lost in case of any 
failure of equipment or communication network. 
3)
The system should work even in an offline mode with the critical functionality 
4) 
The system should be designed to have satisfactory performance even in Police Stations 
connected on low-bandwidth 
5) 
The system should be implemented using Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and have a 
modular design 
6)
The system should be developed on Open Standards 
7) 
The system should be built on a common User Access and Authentication Service to 
ensure Single-Sign on for the end-user 
8)
The system should be developed for a centralized deployment and maintenance 
9)
The system should be developed to be deployed in a 3-tier datacenter architecture 
10) 
The system should be designed to have a n-tier architecture with the presentation logic 
separated from the business logic that is again separated from the data-access logic 
11) 
The system should be extensible to provide access to the interfaces through PDA’s and 
mobile data terminals 
12)
The system should adopt standardized formats and common metadata elements 
13) 
The system should be designed for access through browser-based systems and must 
impose minimal requirements on the client device 
14)
The system must support multiple types of communication services for remote access 
15) 
The system should have capability to support public access to a subset of data and 
functionality 
16)
The system should support multi-tier authentication where required

17)
The system should support SSL encrypted connections 
18)
The system should support secure virtual private network connections 
19) 
The system should use HTTPS as the communication protocol, i.e., HTTP over an 
encrypted secure socket layer (SSL) 
20)
The system should run on multiple browsers 
21)
The system should support selective encryption of the stored data 
22) 
The system should ensure secure transmission of data over the network and utilize SSL 
and 2-way digital signatures 
23) 
The system should ensure high standards of security and access control through: 
a) Prevent cross-site scripting 
b) Validate the incoming data / user request 
c) Encode the incoming data / user request 
d) Prevent SQL Injection 
e) Utilize parameterized queries 
f) Sanitize the user-inputs 
g) Validate the data both at the client and server 
h) Do not allow hard delete and perform only soft tagging the row for deletion 
24) 
The system should ensure high scalability and performance through: 
a) Use of cache for storing frequent data 
b) Use of AJAX based technology to improve user experience. Aggressive page loading to 
be considered based on the screen and estimate usage pattern 
c) Leverage Asynchronous HTTP socket capabilities of web server for scalability and 
performance 
d) Host all the static content (documents, images) on the web server 
e) The search results should be fetched from the database in batches of 10 or 20 maximum 
as configured within the application 
f) Display of records on the screen in batches/paged manner 
g) The search should fetch only the fields that need to be displayed to the user. Only when 
the user clicks on a particular record to view its further details should a query be fired to 
fetch the additional details for this particular record only 
h) A hierarchical cache should be configured and used for caching of results of most
